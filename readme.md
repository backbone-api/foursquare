# Backbone API: Foursquare

Backbone.js helper for Foursquare requests

## Install

Using Bower:
```
bower install backbone.api.foursquare
```

## Usage

The plugin will try to create a global namespace ```Foursquare``` that will host all the Models/Views/Collections mirrored from Backbone.API.Foursquare

Common Backbone.js conventions apply using the _Foursquare_ namespace. For example:

```
var user = new Foursquare.Models.User();
```
